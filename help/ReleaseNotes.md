# Link Release Notes

 ## Version 2.1.0
  - [Link.Create](Link.Create.md): `source`=`both` has been removed. It used to copy from namespace to directory, then the other way.
  - [Link.Create](Link.Create.md): `source`=`auto` has been added. It uses the non-empty side of the link as the source.
  - Link.List has been renamed to [Link.Status](Link.Status.md)
  - [Link.Fix](Link.Fix.md) now correctly expects text source for arrays (as produced by âŽ•SE.Dyalog.Array.Serialise), as documented, whereas Link 2.0 expected the array itself. Similarly, the source (rather than the array itself) is correctly reported by the `beforeWrite` callback.
  - [Link.Break](Link.Break.md) has a `recursive` flag to break all children namespaces if they are linked to their own directories
  - [Link.Create](Link.Create.md) has a `fastLoad` flag to reduce the load time by not inspecting source to detect name clashes
  - `beforeWrite` had been split into two callbacks : `beforeWrite` when actually about to write to file, and `getFilename` when querying the file name to use (see the [Link.Create documentation](Link.Create.md) for more details).
  - `beforeWrite` and `beforeRead` arguments have been refactored into a more consistent set.

 ## Version 2.0.0
  - [Link.Break](Link.Break.md) has an `all` flag to break all links
  - [Link.Version](Link.Version.md) reports the current version number  
  - Initial public release
