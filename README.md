# Link
Link enables the use of text files as the primary storage mechanism for APL source code, and is expected to replace the use of traditional binary workspaces and component files for many new APL projects.

Two significantly different versions of Link are currently available:

## Version 3.0
Version 3.0 is secheduled for distribution with the next release of Dyalog APL, and works with version 18.0. It is recommended to anyone getting started with Link and Dyalog APL, and HAS [online documentation](https://dyalog.github.io/link/). The source for this documentation is in the `docs` folder and deployed using `mkdocs` and `mike`, hosted with GitHub Pages.

This version is actively developed in the master branch of this repository and supported via GitHub issues. Some versions of this code still identify themselves as version 2.1, but there are now so many behavioural changes that that version number will be bumped to 3.0 by early September 2021.

## Version 2.0
Version 2.0 is distributed with Dyalog APL versions 17.1 and 18.0. It is no longer being actively developed. Support (and fixes if necessary) are available to Dyalog customers via our normal support channels.

[Version 2.0 has separate documentation](https://github.com/Dyalog/link/blob/2.0/help/Home.md), including a [Version 2.0 API reference](https://github.com/Dyalog/link/blob/2.0/help/API.md).
