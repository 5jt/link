 Breathe
    ⍝ Breathe is sometimes required to allow FileSystemWatcher events which are still in the
    ⍝ queue to be processed. They can sometimes exist despite asserts having succeeded
    ⍝ Without Breathe, such events can run in parallel with and interfere with the next test
    ⍝ causing "random" (timing-dependent) failures
    ⍝ Also sometimes the FSW has create+change events on file write,
    ⍝ producing two callbacks to notify, the first one making assert succeeds,
    ⍝ then the second one conflicting with whichever code is run after the assert (e.g. a ⎕FIX which would be undone by the pending second Notify)
 →USE_MOCK_FSW⍴0 ⍝ Not needed when we are mocking the FSW

 :If ⎕SE.Link.Watcher.DOTNET ⋄ ⎕DL 0.1  ⍝ FileSystemWatcher
 :Else ⋄ ⎕DL 2.1×⎕SE.Link.Watcher.INTERVAL ⍝ ensure two runs
 :EndIf
