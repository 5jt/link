 Describe
    ⍝ This function exists in order to record comments from the single script version of the Test namespace

    ⍝ Put the Link system and FileSystemWatcher through it's paces
    ⍝ Call Run with a right argument containing a folder name which can be used for the test
    ⍝ For example:
    ⍝   Run 'c:\tmp\linktest'

    ⍝ - test quadVars.apln produced by Acre
    ⍝   ':Namespace quadVars'  '##.(⎕IO ⎕ML ⎕WX)←0 1 3'  ':EndNamespace'
    ⍝ - test ⎕SE.Link.Add '⎕IO', and that subsequent script fix observed it (⎕SIGNAL (⎕IO≠0)/11)
    ⍝ - proper QA for arrays and tradns add/expunge
    ⍝ - test invalid files / hidden files / files with nasty side effects on fix
    ⍝   and that ⎕SE.Link reports about them
    ⍝ - ensure beforeRead is called at Create/Import time
    ⍝   and that our special format is not loaded by link (which would fail)
    ⍝ - ensure beforeWrite is called at Create/Export time
    ⍝   and that files are not overwritten by link
    ⍝ - case-code+flatten (on sub-directories)
    ⍝ - test UCMD's with modifiers
    ⍝ - test basic git usage

    ⍝ TODO test ⎕ED :
    ⍝ - renaming a function in ⎕ED (to an existing name and to a non-existing name)
    ⍝ - changing nameclass in ⎕ED
    ⍝ - updating a function with stops
    ⍝ - changing valid source to invalid source (e.g. 'r←foo;')
    ⍝ - editiing a new name and giving it invalid source
